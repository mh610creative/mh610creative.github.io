### USER STORIES

>Everyone’s obsessed with their **23andMe**, but I’m *obsessed with GIFs*. It would be so cool to know what my DNA looks like, but with GIFs, and I'd share the results with my family and friends for a laugh. - Danielle

>Almost anything I can’t post to social media or text to friends is irrelevant. It would be way better if I could share my DNA in a catchy way. If I could text my friends my DNA in GIFs for instance, they would tell their friends, and then, everyone would want to use it. - Courtney

#### WIREFRAME

![Imgur Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/Qgt6SSR.png)

The original wireframe for this project was a very loose concept that was never intended to be end-stage design before code start. The layout and design evolved upon timeline availability subject to completion of pivotal functionality deliverables. 

#### HURDLES/PROBLEMS

* If more runway was available for the project, I would make more decisions in the development of a robust wireframe. Part of these decisions would be to adopt certain CSS properties (i.e. flex-box or grid) to construct the UX on some level as well as the functionality. While I provided myself a detailed step-by-step approach to the Javascript functionality, I wish I mapped the interoperability between the HTML and CSS. I wish I possessed a intermediate to advanced understanding of the GIPHY API in the hopes of predicting the results during the QA phase.  

* I began this project at a conceptual deficit of the required programming concepts necessary to execute. I am most proud that I was able to overcome the deficit to not only execute the project but deliver more than I thought was possible given my capabilities and the time provided. With just enough mandates to classify this as a class project, I am proud that this project is my complete creative vision from end-to-end.

* My application is a noveltly, and I do not foresee direct monetization (platform-based revenue). However, I do forsee this having possible digital marketing or fan engagement applications. My application has more social than solitary value, so I would add functionality to either directly post or convert the output GIFs into a file that could be posted to any social media with ease. Otherwise, it is useless. 

* I learned basic HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, Asynchronous Javascript, and XML. I learned the core fundamentals of the process of developing and deploying a web based application. I learned how to effectively communicate with other engineers to debug my project code. I learned I have enough of "the right stuff" to be a software engineer.
