### USER STORIES

>Everyone’s obsessed with their **23andMe**, but I’m *obsessed with GIFs*. It would be so cool to know what my DNA looks like, but with GIFs, and I'd share the results with my family and friends for a laugh. - Danielle

>Almost anything I can’t post to social media or text to friends is irrelevant. It would be way better if I could share my DNA in a catchy way. If I could text my friends my DNA in GIFs for instance, they would tell their friends, and then, everyone would want to use it. - Courtney
